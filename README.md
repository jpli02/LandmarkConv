# LandmarkConv
Efficient Convolutional Module for Semantic Understanding


This work is an extended version for the convolutional module in [LBYL-Net](https://github.com/svip-lab/LBYLNet)


* Operator for general semantic understanding tasks like semantic segmentation and visual grounding


* Easily being inserted into layers


* Efficient computational process with linear space and time
